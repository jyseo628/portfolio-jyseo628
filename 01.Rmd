## Direct mails and street fundraising are still popular in Korea!

Do direct mails and street fundraising sound like 90's? Surprisingly, they are still the leading fundraising channels in South Korea. Even though the size of nonprofit sector has rapidly grown in the past two decades, the sustainability of the organizations still relies on 90's tactics. This leads to 2 major problems in facilitating the development of nonprofit sector: 1) Despite of huge amount of data collected on basic donor information, crucial information about donors' interests is still missing. 2) Accumulated donor information is thus not properly analyzed to better understand donors for sustainable fundraising opportunities. 


## Engage with donors and predict how they'll react

Predictive modeling accompanied with AB testing can help NPOs to solve such problems and optimize fundraising practices.
In order to build predictive models, digitalizing main fundraising channels should be preceded first to collect meaningful data. NPOs can track donors' behaviors from its website, social media channels, and emails with constantly evolving AB tests. As a result, NPOs can gather information on donors' area of interests - what topics they are enthusiastic for? by how much? - and the magnitude of their willingness to give - donor type, number of gifts, number of years giving, average donation amount.
Building predictive models based on such collected data allows NPOs to construct donor segmentation and identify loyal donors. NPOs can then apply diverse marketing tools to each segmented group, and as a result, build stronger relationships with loyal donors and raise retention rates. By engaging deeply with existing donors, NPOs can upgrade donation amount and/or convert donor types more effectively.
Predictive models can be the most effective in planned giving. By evaluating donation patterns of regular donors, who are generally more open to further donations, NPOs can fully optimize fundraising opportunities, since successfully retaining existing donors is much more cost effective than recruiting new donors. Loyal donors have tendency to become active ambassadors of NPOs and on seldom occasions to legacy donors, who are most prevalent in the most matured community.


## The Art of Data Science

Implementing data collection protocol and building up meaningful data will be time consuming and costly. Given the society's familiarity with analogue fundraising, abrupt changes might lead to temporary lag in fundraising. Data analyses will also not happen overnight with existing database systems and human resources: NPOs will need the right tools and talents. However, such recession is a growing pain in order to optimize long-term fundraising efficiency.
In addition, NPOs should also remember that the primary goal is to engage with the donors more deeply. They should not be too focused on the science of the data and get carried away from emotional engagement! [@maclaughlin2017]
