# Help Koreans help others!

Improving fundraising culture in South Korea


## Direct mails and street fundraising are still popular in Korea!

Do direct mails and street fundraising sound like 1990's? Surprisingly, they are still the leading fundraising channels in South Korea. Even though the size of nonprofit sector has rapidly grown and numerous organizations have been formed in the past 2 decades, the sustainability of the organizations still rely on 1990's tactics. Majority of nonprofit organizations still use paper signup sheets to acquire new donors from street fundraising and direct mailing. This leads to 2 major problems in facilitating the development of nonprofit sector: 1) Even though huge amount of basic donor information gets accumulated in the organizations' database systems, crucial information about donors' interests is not collected. 2) Accumulated donor information is thus only used as a mere means to draw the next round donation, not to better understand donors for sustainable fundraising opportunities.


## Know your donors better.

To solve these problems, two measures can be taken. First is to regulate data capture protocol, and second is to build predictive models to better understand donors.

In order to accumulate meaningful data from every donor, digitalization of fundraising channel is crucial. By activating and tracking the organization's social media, websites, and emails to acquire new donors and communicate with existing donors, an organization can easily keep track of the interests of its donors. For offline donor acquisition, asking the right questions will be important, given the time constraint of handwritten signups - if the questionnaire is too long and too private, it will discourage people to sign up.

To better understand the donors and identify further fundraising opportunities, I plan to build predictive models to dissect donor behaviors by asking two questions: What drives them to donate? and How much are they likely to give (more)?
In order to answer the first question, lots of testing and collecting additional data will be crucial by tracking the results of test emails, social media traffics, website traffics, and event attendances. By continuously asking donors what triggers their philanthropy, we can better reflect what is meaningful to donors on our marketing tools.
In addition to marketing contents, I would also like to analyze donors giving behaviors and donation data. By dividing donors by donor types (one-time, regular, legacy, major), number of gifts, average donation amount, and number of years donating, we can identify their correlations with age, employment info, income level, and other demographic features.

Utilizing the predictive models and capturing the right data should evolve together by feeding information back to each other continuously.


## The Art of Data Science

Building data collection protocol will help to gather information of not only the basic demographics of donors, but also their motivations for giving. And studying such collected data of donors' interests and giving behaviors, we can then construct donor segmentation and carry out further tests for each segmented group. For example, we might find out that the majority of the donation might come from small portion of donor group. In that case, we need to apply different communication tools for that group in order to engage them more deeply.
As a result of evolving tests, nonprofit organizations will be able to engage with loyal donors, raise retention rates, and even create supporter groups.
However, such implementation of data collection and analyses will not happen overnight with existing database systems and human resources: they will need time and the right tools/talents. They should also remember that the primary goal here is to engage with the donors more deeply. They should not be too focused on the science of the data and get carried away from emotional engagement!
