## Direct mails and street fundraising are still popular in Korea!

Do direct mails and street fundraising sound like 90's? Surprisingly, they are still the leading fundraising channels in South Korea. Despite general perception that Korea is well advanced in technology, application of data in decision making is an overdue task for most corporates, and especially for nonprofit organizations (NPO). Given the closed culture and language barriers, Koreans have developed Korean-only platforms and services rather than adapting U.S-based advanced platforms - Naver for Google, Kakaotalk for imessage/Whatsapp, and Jandi for Slack - and fundraising data processing platform is not an exception: Human Software, which merely provides minimal B.I. dashboard, for Salesforce. Even though the size of nonprofit sector has rapidly grown in the past two decades, the sustainability of the organizations still relies on 90's tactics. This leads to 2 major problems in facilitating the development of nonprofit sector: 1) Despite of massive data collected on demographic donor information, critical information about donors' interests is still missing. 2) Accumulated donor information is not properly analyzed to better understand donors' behaviors, and thus not applied to optimize sustainable fundraising opportunities.

## Engage with donors and predict how they'll react

Predictive modeling complemented with AB tests can help NPOs to solve such problems and optimize fundraising practices.
NPOs can start by segmenting donors into groups based on pre-collected demographic information, such as donor type, gender, age, income level, average gift size, number of gifts, number of years giving, and average donation amount. Then, AB tests can be run across multiple demographic dimensions on variables of marketing content and ask patterns. Marketing content variables range from fundraising topics, tone of voice, to designs donation buttons on emails, and ask pattern variables include fundraising channels, number of asks, and types of asks. From these tests, NPOs can learn about what donors engage with. One key point is that donors' behaviors and interests constantly change, and thus should AB tests. As a result of evolving AB tests, donors can be re-segmented by grouping based on what they engage with, rather than mere demographic information.

Now that NPOs better understand donors' motivations, they can predict the most effective way to communicate with newly segmented groups, or each donor. For example, traditional fundraising tactics might still work best with the older age groups, while digitalization might be critical for targeting younger groups by activating social media channels and utilizing email asks. For donors who are particularly enthusiastic about emergency fundraising, NPOs can send urgent asks with frequent situation updates. By applying personalized marketing with predictive models, NPOs can dramatically increase the giving amount and retain donors for a longer period of time.

Beyond marketing content, another advantage of predictive models is to identify loyal donors - who will give more often, larger amount, for a longer period of time. Predicting who is willing to give more in amount and frequency, NPOs can really target and ask these donors to upgrade in donation amount, convert to a regular donor, or give a larger amount for emergency cases like natural disasters. By targeting the right donors to engage further, NPOs can efficiently allocate budget in cultivating donors with higher lifetime value and fully optimize fundraising opportunities. In addition, predictive models can be the most effective in planned giving, which is a form of donation prevalent in the most matured community, because it requires the deepest engagement with donors.  


## The Art of Data Science

Predictive models will enable NPOs to constantly adapt marketing tools and donation asks for the right target groups and individuals. Since successfully retaining existing donors is much more cost effective than recruiting new donors, targeted fundraising will most certainly bring higher retention rate and higher lifetime values, and opportunities for planned giving. By opening up the chances of cultivating planned givers, Korea will be one step closer to becoming a mature country in giving culture.
On a short-term note, accumulating meaningful datasets and drawing conclusions from AB tests will be time consuming and costly. Given the society's familiarity with traditional fundraising, abrupt changes in fundraising channels and communications might lead to temporary lag in fundraising. Data analyses will not happen overnight with existing database systems and human resources, and hiring the right talent will be tough on NPOs tight budget. Even though advanced analytical tools are already abundant in U.S. and European market, the barriers will not be overcome overnight. However, such difficulties are necessary growing pains in optimizing long-term fundraising efficiency. Well equipped with strong datasets and evolving targeting, NPOs will be able to maximize the lifetime value of donors.
In applying data science, NPOs should also remember that the primary goal is to engage with the donors more deeply. They should not be too focused on the science of the data and get carried away from emotional engagement!
