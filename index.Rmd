### Abstract of my first idea {-}

Data science can improve relationship building practices in non-profit sector of Korea, by understanding donors' giving behaviors. Consistent data analyses through AB testing and predictive modeling will enable nonprofit organizations to identify loyal donors who have higher life-time value and higher motivation to give, and therefore to raise funds more efficiently.



### Abstract of my second idea {-}

Machine learning algorithm can analyze people's smartphone behaviors and detect depressed individuals who are at risk of committing suicides. In South Korea, where mental weakness is stigmatized to a degree to prevent people from receiving medical help, such machine learning algorithm can help troubled individuals in private without revealing their identity.
