## Is North Korea the biggest threat to South Korea?

Despite the severity of high and increasing trends, countermeasures by the government have been inefficient. For instance, the handrails on Mapo bridge, where many suicides were reported, have been equipped with motion sensors to sense movements for suicide, lighting up with short phrases and showing photos of happy families among other things. However, suicide rates on Mapo bridge has actually increased after the sensors were implemented, and now it's even called "the suicide bridge." Fundamental reason of such happening is government's lack of understanding the nature of suicidal individuals, and therefore, what support such individuals need. In their defense, the difficulty of understanding motives of depressed citizens is because of social stigma against people who visit psychiatrists or therapists, making them "crazy people." Therefore, the existing Suicide Prevention Center stands for the sake of existence without actual visitors. Instead of approaching this problem prematurely, Korean government needs to take the right measure. 
 
 
## Machine learning for saving lives

Machine learning algorithms can help Korean government to save lives of citizens at risk of suicides, by detecting them in earlier stage. MLA can utilize citizens' data on smartphone behaviors in order to understand correlation between smartphone behaviors and symptoms of depression, and therefore to predict and identify individuals who will need help. What makes this goal remarkably accessible is the application Kakaotalk, the single most-used messenger/SNS platform for Koreans: 43 out of 51 million Koreans are active users (84% penetration). This application also provides other tools, such as audio/video calls, shopping platform (with KakaoPay), news browsing platform, search engine, and banking services - It is Facebook + Google + Amazon in Korea.

First task is to collect meaningful data of depressed citizens' behaviors and analyze them. Suicide Prevention Center can open a private hotline on Kakaotalk application, so that citizens have easy access to reach out for help without risking revelation of their identification other than phone numbers. For individuals who reached out and agreed to share data, we can collect their behavioral data of chats, public posts, purchase patterns, engine searching patterns, and vocal cues on calls, and feed them into our machine learning algorithms to find consistent patterns among these users that are different from others. Diverse tools can be utilized to collect meaningful data, including natural language processing for private chats and keyword search patterns and image/text mining for public posts.

Next is to process and understand accumulated data, in order to find correlations between smartphone behaviors and suicidal thoughts. For an example, the algorithm might learn from past data that "people who are contemplating ending their lives rarely use the word 'suicide'; words like 'ibuprofen' or 'bridge' are better indicators of suicidal thoughts." [@Reardon] Or the result might show that depressed individuals exhibit impulsive behaviors in shopping or posting anonymous public messages on posts. Since there are many resources of diverse angles, there might also be simultaneous factors that show strong evidence of emotional discomfort. After enough evidences are collected, the algorithms can now detect which individuals show symptoms of depression or signs of suicidal attempts and predict the risks of their suicidal thoughts and actions.

Finally, after detection, algorithm can flag automatically Suicide Prevention Center to approach such citizens at emotional risks, based on the severity of their status. Intervention can be in many forms, such as exposing them with heart-warming quotes as a form of online ad, or even with SPC hotline advertisements. Most effective methods and their results would also have to be constantly fed into the algorithms to develop promising measures to save lives.
By intervening at an earlier stage before people develop extreme thoughts to end their own lives, Suicide Prevention Center can actually prevent suicides and provide appropriate help to regain strength to carry on.


## Do they want to be detected?

Utilizing "passive" data in pursuit of detecting depressed individuals can be invading privacy of people, because they never agreed on sharing private chats or smartphone behaviors to diagnose for depression specifically. And there is no guarantee that these detections and interventions are 100% correct - there will be false positives.
Moreover, given the sensitivity of topic, point of intervention can also be controversial, since the users never agreed with intervention as well. Abrupt intervention might backfire and push them even further away from opening up to receiving help. Extra caution will be needed in identifying and approaching individuals with depression.

However, if implemented properly without causing users' resentment, machine learning algorithms will be very effective, especially considering the social context of South Korean culture where mental illness is stigmatized. Private approach without revelation of identification could reduce suicidal rate significantly.
Moreover, if data is collected continuously, machine learning will also be able to find fundamental reasons behind people's suicides, some of which might be related to social structure of Korea. From the fact that suicide rates are higher in teenage groups and elderly, it's apparent that social welfare is not well established for weak social groups. By understanding specific and accurate reasons of difficulties for weak groups, Korean government can take measures to make fundamental adjustment in social systems to better citizens' lives.

Machine learning algorithms can help Korean government to intervene with citizens who show signs of suicidal attempts by detecting them in an earlier stage. MLA can utilize citizens' data on smartphone behaviors and understand correlation between behavioral data and symptoms of depression or other mental disorders, in order to identify individuals in need of help. What makes this process remarkably accessible is the application Kakaotalk, the single most-used messenger/SNS platform for Koreans: 43 out of 51 million Koreans are active users (84% penetration).
