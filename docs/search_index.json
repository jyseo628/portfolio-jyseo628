Keywords data science, fundraising, predictive modeling, nonprofit, NPO, Korea, ABtest 1.1 Direct mails and street fundraising are still popular in Korea! Do direct mails and street fundraising sound like 90’s? Despite widespread perception that Korea is well advanced in technology, direct mails and street fundraising are still the leading fundraising channels in South Korea. Even though the size of nonprofit sector has rapidly grown in the past two decades, the sustainability still relies on 90’s tactics. This leads to 2 major problems in facilitating the development of nonprofit sector: 1) Despite of massive data collected on donors’ demographic information, critical information about donors’ interests is still missing. 2) Accumulated donor information is not properly analyzed to better engage with donors, and thus not applied to optimize sustainable fundraising. Lack of engagement with donors results in inefficiency of nonprofit organizations’ (NPO) fundraising, because acquiring new donors is costly, whereas “retaining donors by building a relationship [allows] organizations [to] spend less time and effort.” (Foran 2017) Application of data in decision making is still an overdue task for most corporates in Korea, especially for NPOs. “The key is moving from simply collecting data to actually leveraging nonprofit’s data in the right ways,” in order to bring fundraising practices of nonprofit sector to maturity. (MacLaughlin 2017) 1.2 Engage with donors and predict how they’ll react Predictive modeling complemented with AB tests can help NPOs to solve such problems and optimize fundraising practices. NPOs can start by segmenting donors into groups based on pre-collected demographic information, such as donor type, gender, age, income level, average gift size, number of gifts, number of years giving, and average donation amount. Then, AB tests can be run across multiple demographic dimensions on variables of marketing content and solicitation patterns. Marketing content variables range from fundraising topics, tone of voice, to donation button designs, and solicitation pattern variables include fundraising channels, number of asks, and types of asks. From the test results, NPOs can learn about what donors engage with. NPOs should remember that donors’ behaviors and interests constantly change, and thus should AB tests. With evolving AB tests, donors can be re-segmented more meaningfully based on what they engage with, rather than mere demographic information. Now that NPOs better understand donors’ motivations, they can predict the most effective ways to communicate with newly segmented groups. For example, traditional fundraising tactics might still work best with older age groups, while digitalization of activating social media channels and utilizing email solicitation might be critical for targeting younger groups. For donors who are particularly enthusiastic about emergency fundraising, NPOs can send urgent asks with frequent situation updates. By applying personalized marketing with predictive models, NPOs can retain donors for a longer period of time. Beyond marketing content, another advantage of predictive models is to identify loyal donors - who will give more often, larger amount, for a longer period of time. Predicting who is willing to give more in amount and frequency, NPOs can really target them to upgrade in donation amount, convert to a regular donor, or give additionally for emergency cases like natural disasters. By targeting the right donors to engage further, NPOs can efficiently allocate budget in cultivating donors with higher lifetime value and fully optimize fundraising opportunities. In addition, predictive models can be the most effective in planned donation, such as legacy or major donation, which is a form of donation prevalent in the most matured community, because it requires the deepest engagement with donors. By opening up the chances of cultivating planned givers, Korea will be one step closer to becoming a mature country in giving culture. 1.3 The Art of Data Science Predictive models will enable NPOs in Korea to constantly adapt marketing tools and solicitation methods for the right target groups, and engage more deeply with donors. This will result in not only higher retention rates and lifetime values, but also opportunities for planned donation. Since “a 10% increase in donor retention can increase the lifetime value of donor database by 200%,” NPOs will be able to optimize sustainable fundraising practices, equipped with evolving datasets and models. (Sargeant and Jay 2004) Collecting meaningful datasets and analyzing them will be time consuming and costly, given existing database systems and human resources: NPOs will need the right tools and talents. Given the society’s familiarity with traditional fundraising, abrupt changes might lead to temporary lag in fundraising. Even advanced analytical tools available in the market will not be adapted to Korean market overnight. However, I think such difficulties are necessary growing pains in promoting the sustainable growth of nonprofit sector in Korea. In addition, in applying data science, NPOs should remember that the primary goal is to engage with the donors more deeply. They should not be too focused on the science and get carried away from emotional engagement! Bibliography "],
["Stop-the-killing.html", "2 People-saving algorithms 2.1 Suicide: A Bigger Threat than North Korea 2.2 Machine Learning for Saving Lives 2.3 Do They Want to be Detected?", " 2 People-saving algorithms Keywords Data Science, machine learning, algorithm, prevent, suicide, South Korea 2.1 Suicide: A Bigger Threat than North Korea According to the OECD Health Statistics 2015, an average of 29.1 people per 100,000 committed suicide in 2012 in South Korea, which is about 2 1/2 times the OECD average of 11.9. It is the highest suicidal rate among OECD countries, especially for teenagers and elders of age more than 60. (OECD 2018) Suicide is the No.1 cause of death among Koreans aged 10 to 39. Even without North Korea’s threat, South Korea has enough killings on their own. Despite the severity of high and increasing trends, countermeasures by the government have been inefficient. For instance, the handrails on Mapo bridge, where many suicides were reported, have been equipped with motion sensors to sense movements for suicide, lighting up with short phrases and showing photos of happy families among other things. However, suicide rates on Mapo bridge has actually increased after the sensors were implemented, and now it’s even called “the suicide bridge.” Fundamental reason of such happening is government’s lack of understanding the nature of suicidal individuals, and therefore, what support such individuals need. In their defense, the difficulty of understanding motives of depressed citizens is because of social stigma against people who visit psychiatrists or therapists, making them “crazy people.” Therefore, the existing Suicide Prevention Center stands for the sake of existence without actual visitors. Instead of approaching this problem prematurely, Korean government needs to take the right measure. Machine learning algorithm will help Korean government to solve this social problem by associating behavioral patterns with suicidal risks and by detecting individuals at risk. 2.2 Machine Learning for Saving Lives Machine Learning Algorithm can first collect training data on citizens’ smartphone behaviors in order to correlate smartphone behaviors with symptoms of depression and use these findings to predict and identify individuals at risk of suicides. As a result, Korean government can intervene with depressed individuals’ life before they make dangerous decisions. First task is to collect meaningful training dataset of depressed citizens’ behaviors on smartphones and feed them into the algorithm to correlate them with suicidal thoughts. What makes this task remarkably accessible is the application Kakaotalk, the single most-used messenger/SNS platform for Koreans: 49.8 out of 51 million Koreans are active users (97% penetration). (Smith 2017) This application also provides other tools, such as audio/video calls, shopping platform (with KakaoPay), news browsing platform, search engine, and banking services - It is Facebook + Google + Amazon of Korea. Suicide Prevention Center can open a private hotline on Kakaotalk application, so that citizens can reach out for help without risking revelation of their identification other than phone numbers. From individuals who reached out to hotline and agreed to share data, we can collect their behavioral data of chats, public posts, purchase patterns, engine searching patterns, and vocal cues on calls as a training dataset, and feed them into our machine learning algorithms. Diverse tools can be utilized to collect meaningful data, including natural language processing for private chats and keyword search patterns and image/text mining for public posts. Once enough training data has been accumulated, machine learning algorithm can find consistent patterns among depressed users that are distinct from regular smartphone behaviors of general public to correlate them with suicidal thoughts. For an example, the algorithm might learn from dataset that “people who are contemplating ending their lives rarely use the word ‘suicide’; words like ‘ibuprofen’ or ‘bridge’ are better indicators of suicidal thoughts.” (Reardon 2017) Or the data might show that depressed individuals exhibit impulsive behaviors in shopping or posting anonymous public messages on others’ posts. Since there are resources of diverse angles available, from chatting to searching and purchasing, there might also be concurrent behaviors that together show strong evidences of emotional discomfort. Such findings can be defined as triggers to flag suicidal actions, when run against larger datasets. Finally, now that smartphone behaviors associated with suicidal risks have been defined, algorithm can be run on the entire dataset of Kakaotalk users to detect which individuals show symptoms of depression or signs of suicidal attempts and predict the degree of risks. After detection, algorithm can automatically notify Suicide Prevention Center to approach such citizens at emotional risks, based on the severity of their status. Intervention can be conducted in many forms, such as exposing them with heart-warming quotes as a form of online ad, or even with Suicide Prevention Center hotline advertisements. Most effective methods and their results would also have to be constantly fed into the algorithms to determine and strengthen promising measures to save lives. Repetition of identifying depressed people and taking action will continuously generate data stream to be fed back into the algorithm to improve efficiency. By intervening at an earlier stage before people develop extreme thoughts to end their own lives, Suicide Prevention Center can actually prevent suicides and provide appropriate help them to regain strength to carry on. 2.3 Do They Want to be Detected? Even though the potential of saving citizens at suicidal risks, there are downfalls of this machine learning algorithm. First, utilizing “passive” data in pursuit of detecting depressed individuals can be invading privacy of people, because they never agreed on sharing contents of private chats or smartphone behaviors to diagnose for depression specifically. Primary solution is to send out push notifications to all users for a new consent form, but this can also end up being a formality. Another option is to allow users to opt out from being screened for detection of depression. In addition, point of intervention can also be controversial, since the users never agreed with interventions as well. Abrupt intervention might backfire and push them even further away from opening up to receiving help or affect them even more negatively by coercing unwanted revelation of their emotional status to a stranger. This risk might be reduced by strengthening the algorithm on effects of intervention after measures are taken. The more data is accumulated and studied, the more negative impact of intervention will be reduced. Despite potential downside mentioned above, if implemented properly without causing users’ resentment, this machine learning algorithm will effectively prevent potential suicides, especially considering the social context of South Korean culture where mental illness is stigmatized. Private approach without revelation of identification could reduce suicidal rate significantly. Moreover, if data is collected continuously, the algorithm will also be able to find fundamental reasons behind people’s suicides, some of which might be related to social structure of Korea. From the fact that suicide rates are higher in teenage groups and elderly, it’s apparent that social welfare is not well established for weak social groups. By understanding specific and accurate reasons of difficulties for weak groups, Korean government can take measures to make fundamental adjustment in social systems to better citizens’ lives.
