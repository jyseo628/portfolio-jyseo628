Keywords data science, fundraising, predictive modeling, nonprofit, NPO, Korea, ABtest 1.1 Direct mails and street fundraising are still popular in Korea! Do direct mails and street fundraising sound like 90’s? Despite widespread perception that Korea is well advanced in technology, direct mails and street fundraising are still the leading fundraising channels in South Korea. Even though the size of nonprofit sector has rapidly grown in the past two decades, the sustainability still relies on 90’s tactics. This leads to 2 major problems in facilitating the development of nonprofit sector: 1) Despite of massive data collected on donors’ demographic information, critical information about donors’ interests is still missing. 2) Accumulated donor information is not properly analyzed to better engage with donors, and thus not applied to optimize sustainable fundraising. Lack of engagement with donors results in inefficiency of nonprofit organizations’ (NPO) fundraising, because acquiring new donors is costly, whereas “retaining donors by building a relationship [allows] organizations [to] spend less time and effort.” (Foran 2017) Application of data in decision making is still an overdue task for most corporates in Korea, especially for NPOs. “The key is moving from simply collecting data to actually leveraging nonprofit’s data in the right ways,” in order to bring fundraising practices of nonprofit sector to maturity. (MacLaughlin 2017) 1.2 Engage with donors and predict how they’ll react Predictive modeling complemented with AB tests can help NPOs to solve such problems and optimize fundraising practices. NPOs can start by segmenting donors into groups based on pre-collected demographic information, such as donor type, gender, age, income level, average gift size, number of gifts, number of years giving, and average donation amount. Then, AB tests can be run across multiple demographic dimensions on variables of marketing content and solicitation patterns. Marketing content variables range from fundraising topics, tone of voice, to donation button designs, and solicitation pattern variables include fundraising channels, number of asks, and types of asks. From the test results, NPOs can learn about what donors engage with. NPOs should remember that donors’ behaviors and interests constantly change, and thus should AB tests. With evolving AB tests, donors can be re-segmented more meaningfully based on what they engage with, rather than mere demographic information. Now that NPOs better understand donors’ motivations, they can predict the most effective ways to communicate with newly segmented groups. For example, traditional fundraising tactics might still work best with older age groups, while digitalization of activating social media channels and utilizing email solicitation might be critical for targeting younger groups. For donors who are particularly enthusiastic about emergency fundraising, NPOs can send urgent asks with frequent situation updates. By applying personalized marketing with predictive models, NPOs can retain donors for a longer period of time. Beyond marketing content, another advantage of predictive models is to identify loyal donors - who will give more often, larger amount, for a longer period of time. Predicting who is willing to give more in amount and frequency, NPOs can really target them to upgrade in donation amount, convert to a regular donor, or give additionally for emergency cases like natural disasters. By targeting the right donors to engage further, NPOs can efficiently allocate budget in cultivating donors with higher lifetime value and fully optimize fundraising opportunities. In addition, predictive models can be the most effective in planned donation, such as legacy or major donation, which is a form of donation prevalent in the most matured community, because it requires the deepest engagement with donors. By opening up the chances of cultivating planned givers, Korea will be one step closer to becoming a mature country in giving culture. 1.3 The Art of Data Science Predictive models will enable NPOs in Korea to constantly adapt marketing tools and solicitation methods for the right target groups, and engage more deeply with donors. This will result in not only higher retention rates and lifetime values, but also opportunities for planned donation. Since “a 10% increase in donor retention can increase the lifetime value of donor database by 200%,” NPOs will be able to optimize sustainable fundraising practices, equipped with evolving datasets and models. (Sargeant and Jay 2004) Collecting meaningful datasets and analyzing them will be time consuming and costly, given existing database systems and human resources: NPOs will need the right tools and talents. Given the society’s familiarity with traditional fundraising, abrupt changes might lead to temporary lag in fundraising. Even advanced analytical tools available in the market will not be adapted to Korean market overnight. However, I think such difficulties are necessary growing pains in promoting the sustainable growth of nonprofit sector in Korea. In addition, in applying data science, NPOs should remember that the primary goal is to engage with the donors more deeply. They should not be too focused on the science and get carried away from emotional engagement! Bibliography "],

And a text reference! An abstract is all three acts of your story in a tight little package. You may or may not want to give the ending away, but if you think there’s a chance an audience will read this and nothing else, you’d better convey your argument here in miniature. People are busy after all, and there’s just so much good tv on the Internet these days. Keywords Data Science, AI, algorithm, prevent, suicide, South Korea 2.1 No.1 suicide rate among OECD countries “According to the OECD Health Statistics 2015, an average of 29.1 people per 100,000 committed suicide in 2012 [in South Korea], about 2 1/2 times the OECD average of 11.9.” South Korea has the highest suicidal rate among OECD countries, especially for children of age 10-19, and elderly group (60+). (???) Without comparison to other countries, suicide is the No.1 cause of death among Koreans aged 10 to 39. Despite the severity of high and increasing trends, countermeasures by the government have been insufficient and inefficient. “In 2016, only $7 million was spent on mental health, when compared to Japan, which has a similar problem but has started spending $130 million each year on suicide prevention and awareness.” (???) 2.2 Machine learning for saving lives Machine learning algorithms can prevent people from ending their lives, by detecting citizens who show signs of suicidal attempts for intervention. Korean government can utilize citizens’ data on smartphone behaviors and develop machine learning algorithms that can correlate behavioral data with symptoms of depression or other mental disorders. Based on text mining and image mining, algorithms can be designed to automatically trigger the flag, when they detect individuals who show symptoms of depression or signs of suicidal attempts. For example, “people who are contemplating ending their lives rarely use the word ‘suicide’; words like ‘ibuprofen’ or ‘bridge’ are better indicators of suicidal thoughts.” (???) Algorithms can be run on collected data regarding people’s language patterns on social media or messaging apps, in-app purchase patterns, and browsing patterns. What makes this process remarkably accessible is the application Kakaotalk, the single most-used messenger/SNS platform for Koreans: 43 out of 51 million Koreans are active users (84% penetration). It also provides shopping (with KakaoPay), news browsing, search engine, and banking services, all in multiple tabs in a single application. By analyzing users’ data of private chats, public posts, purchase patterns, searching patterns, and vocal cues for mood changes, machine learning algorithms can easily detect individuals who show suicidal symptoms. After detection, algorithms can notify Suicide Prevention Center to approach individuals at risk, or suggest them to chat with Suicide Prevention Center hot lines directly. 2.3 Privacy issues Such a tactic can be very effective, considering the social context of South Korean culture, where mental illness is social stigma. Even if people experience depression or other mental illnesses, they find it very difficult to voluntarily and openly look for help, because society stigmatizes people with mental health problems or even past psychiatric treatments. Most of them tend to keep it secret and seek to find solutions on their own. If this algorithm can identify such individuals and help them on hot lines in private chats, it could reduce suicidal rate significantly. However, utilizing “passive” data can be invading privacy of people, because they never agreed on using their private chats to diagnose for depression specifically. The only agreement was at the very beginning when they had signed up a decade ago. And there is no guarantee that these detections and interventions are correct. There will be false positives. Moreover, given the sensitivity of topic, point of intervention can also be controversial. Abrupt intervention can backfire and push them even further away from opening up and receiving help. In identifying and approaching individuals with depression, caution is needed. "],
